== Transliteration

Feature assignments to transliterations are only figurative, and the exact realization of sounds is out of this document's scope.

Further representations are listed in <<explicit-vowels,explicit vowels>>.

=== Consonants

Occlusive representations are primary for duplicates across different manners, and their duplicate fricatives only exist for ergonomics. These duplicate fricatives must not be recognized if <<concise-explicit-vowels,alternative ASCII notation>> for explicit close and long round vowels is active.
