# Summary
This repository contains an [Old Turkish](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code/otk) treebank built upon Old Turkic script texts or sentences that are trivially convertible.


# Introduction
This repository contains a treebank that closely follows the Universal Dependencies guidelines of version 2.7 as published.
This treebank's corpus consists of texts of Turkic script or sentences that are trivially convertible. Trivially
convertible is defined as follows: the transliterated sentence is from a collection written before the
19th century, or closely matches Turkic-script sentences' structure and semantics. For Turkic
script texts, the letter variate choice must match the original.
